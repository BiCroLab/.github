# Welcome to the Bienko-Crosetto Labs! :wave:
We are a team of scientists with diverse academic and cultural backgrounds, working at the intersection between 3D genome biology and cancer genomics. We have a passion for developing innovative methods to advance our understanding of the interplay between genome structure and function, in health and disease.  We are based across two research institutes: [Human Technopole](https://humantechnopole.it/en/research-groups/bienko-group/) and [Karolinska Institutet](https://ki.se/en/research/research-areas-centres-and-networks/research-groups/quantitative-biology-of-the-nucleus-magda-bienko-group#tab-start).
